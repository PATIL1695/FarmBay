## I am tweaking your Smart Harvesting Mobile app to the following
Develop an auction marketplace for Farmers call it FarmBay (sounds like eBay)
Here 
a)Farmers can enter the parameters and not just get the farming suggestion, but also predict the yield 
b) they can put their crop yield for auction
c) merchants can bid for their future yield or present stock
so basically an ML powered platform to connect farmers with merchants and wholesellers.

You would need to include weatherAPI, crop related informations and algorithm to predict the yield
You would also need to create auction transaction framework (you might choose blockchain for that)



Project Options:

1- Title: Products Info Feature Built for Customers

Description: When a customer, who is new to the store and the products, enters the desired product into the system, it returns the product consumption sales plus the product popularity based on the most recent number of weekly/monthly purchases. The traditional system only provides the customer review information without specifiying any number or the ranking/standing against other similar products outside. 

Methodology/Resources: Walmart/Costco real-time database, image scanning, data analytics, Android/iOS app development



2- Title: Smart Harvesting Mobile App

Description: When a amateur farmer wants to increase his crop profit, he uses this app to input certain crop-related parameters (location, budget, weather, history, geography, water resoures, etc), and the app outputs certain potential crops that the farmer could harvest with maximum profit. It also outputs any necessary chemical substances that the farmer should use.

3- Title: Alexa As your Friend 

Description: To serve the purpose of the Amazon Alexa, the device follows the user' commands. Some desired features are: proactively suggesting any activity depending upon the user's preference, collecting the user's habits and learning to integrate them into Alexa memory. Alexa is set to talk to the user under the assigned schedule. 

Methodology/Resources: Amazon Alexa API
